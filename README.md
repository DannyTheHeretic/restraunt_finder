### Fun 2 week code sprint done solo
- was just trying to have fun with django and improve my knowledge of Django Apps and Forms, and other things I didn't understand

- What I Gained
  - [X] Forms (Acct Creation, Reviews)
- [X] Pagination (Lighten the server load)
- [X] Hosting my own PGS server (Just Docker Fun things)
- [X] Building an app and hosting it (More Docker)
- [ ] Add Oauth Systems (Just not enough time yet (maybe ill take another week some time))
